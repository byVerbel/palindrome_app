    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      This site is adapted from the final application in
      <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-tutorial"><em>Learn Enough Ruby
        to Be Dangerous</em></a>
      by <a href="https://www.michaelhartl.com/">Michael Hartl</a>,
      a tutorial introduction to the
      <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby programming language</a> that
      is part of
      <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">LearnEnough.com</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even with that, I think is valuable to highlight the fact that I had to make deployment decisions different from
      the ones in the tutorial. I used a different hosting service: <a href="https://www.render.com">Render</a>.
      This is a platform that allows you to deploy web applications with ease. It is a great service that I recommend
      to anyone who is looking for a hosting service as an alternative to Heroku, due to the fact that this no longer
      offers a free tier.
